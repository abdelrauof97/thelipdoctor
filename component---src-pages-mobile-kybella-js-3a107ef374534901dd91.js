When I inject Belkyra into the submental fat, the deoxycholic acid disrupts the cell wall. Belkyra works by disrupting the cellular membrane of fat cells, causing apoptosis or cell death to occur. The dead cells and fat are then cleaned out of the area by your body’s own waste removal system over time. It should be noted that Belkyra is only approved for localized fat removal and may require a number of treatments to achieve the desired results.
