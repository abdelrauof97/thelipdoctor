Dermal Fillers are an important step in preforming a non-surgical facelift procedure, and will rebuild volume in those areas of your face that require it, restoring your natural structure and glow.

Target areas that require dermal fillers will be recommended based on your personal goals and wants as well as our professional assessment. The most commonly involved areas for these fillers are cheeks, lips, the naso-labial folds as well as under the eyes.

A great option for the prevention and treatment of facial lines and wrinkles is neuro-toxin. This is a substance that is produced by the bacteria Clostridium Botulinum and is commonly known as Botox. Botox is injected into your muscle under the skin in micro doses. This neurotoxin inhibits the signals sent by various nerves to our muscles that make them contract. Inhibition of these signals means that the muscle will not contract as strongly and hence there will be no wrinkling on the skin over that muscle. This is a very effective procedure to not only prevent wrinkle formation but inhibiting its root cause.

Stretch marks are not a health concern, since they are not in any way harmful or painful but many patients dislike them because they feel they look unflattering. At my clinic where I provide stretch mark removal in the Greater Toronto area of Mississauga , I find that female patients who are pregnant are particularly concerned with long term solutions to prevent stretch marks and stretch mark treatment. Stretch marks are not dangerous, however, appearance of idiopathic stretch marks can be an indicator of other potential problems in the body including an increase in cortisol levels.

More often in recent years, discerning clients seek safe, effective, non-surgical methods to remove excess body fat and smooth the look of their figure without the need for anesthetic downtime or scars. While the cosmetic and beauty industry is inundated with products and treatments that claim to reduce fat, there are few, non-invasive medical technologies available which are both powerful and reliable to affect real, visible improvements and permanent fat reduction. Cellulite is a very common aesthetic problem, characterized by the uneven texture and dimpled, lumpy skin contours. Its cause is related to subcutaneous fat located under the skin between connective tissues. These fat deposits herniate and bulge between points of tethered, fibrous connective bands which help form structure and adhesion between our tissues. These areas of protruding, thickened fat can change the shape of body parts such as legs, buttocks and arms. The skin surface may also change to resemble orange peel or cottage cheese texture. Luckily, cellulite isn’t dangerous or unhealthy for a person the way that intra-abdominal, visceral fat around the internal organs is. That type of fat deep in the belly must be shed through diet and exercise and can greatly affect a person’s health. Up to 80% of adult women and many men suffer from the appearance of cellulite and fat deposits on their bodies.
